# Summarize the style guidelines that are relevant to your submission

All the plots require a red tag and must adhere to the Econ Sans and Econ Sans cnd fonts. My bar chart has sub-categories, since it used a double scale chart I had to use the two colours 3EBCD2 and A81829 for the axis labels and writing above the axis which explain what is displayed. There was less regulation on the map plot, but scatterplots require a strict colour order. All plots require white backgrounds with n; borders around the plots and figures.

# Clearly state which guidelines are and are not met

Guidelines met;
- Color Schemes 
- Red tag and Line
- Coloured axis labels and caption (bar Chart)
- axis labels sit on top of horizontal grid lines (Bar Chart)
- white background
- no spine/ border around plot figure (Both) (just the bottom x-axis as required (bar chart))
- Source text is 75% black
- Coloured rectangle legend (Map plot)

 Guidelines not met;
 - Font is 'Sans' not 'Econ Sans', likewise for fonts requiring 'Econ Sans Cnd' are instead width accurate 'Sans' fonts
 - Spacing between font lines may not be Exact to pixel precision

# Describe any alterations you would make to your submission with the assistance of the magazineâ€™s team of experienced data journalists.

I would like to be able to ensure the spacing of the different elements of my figures are correct. It would be good to gather more information about roman places/ territories through this era to update and have a more accurate map plot that would ideally show what territory the Roman Empire had control over. Also to gather data that has better date accuracies than the one used would be able to create a smoother bar chart (Maybe even a Line chart) that could show the increase and fall of the Roman Empire for a longer time period with a smaller step size between points.
